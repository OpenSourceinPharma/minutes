### 2022 comments

Feedback summary:

- I wish that the general presentations were a little longer
- Timekeeping could be improved
- The networking meet and greets seemed to flop. No one joined the three times I tried.
- The virtual format diminishes the experience - it's too easy to be distracted by every day work demands.  It didn't seem like the attendance at any given talk was even close to the number of people who registered.
- More downtime and breathing room: the conference had so much good content, but could have used some more and longer breaks
- Being Europe-based, I have had a difficulties to join the programme except the earliest sessions
